Student mental health is a critical issue deserving attention and understanding. Factors ranging from academic stress to personal life challenges can significantly impact a studentâ€™s well-being. This project aims to leverage machine learning to model the probability of depression in students based on several key life factors. Beyond building a predictive tool, this exploration seeks to raise awareness about the importance of mental health and serves as a practical application of data science and machine learning skills.
